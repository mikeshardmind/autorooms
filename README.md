**WARNING**
The bot clones channels which begin with the '⌛' character.
Do not use this bot if you have any channels beginning with the '♻' character and care about those channels, the bot uses this character to denote temporary channels.

# (Quick) How to

With python (supported versions 3.8 through 3.11)
```
AUTOROOMTOKEN='your discord bot token here' python autorooms.py
```

Alternative (currently windows only) using a [standalone release](https://github.com/mikeshardmind/autorooms/releases/)

```
$env:AUTOROOMTOKEN='your discord bot token here'
./autorooms.exe
```

You can also place a file alongside the executable named "autoroom.token" containing the token. 
Standard "don't share your token and don't upload such a file publicly" rules apply.
