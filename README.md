**WARNING**
The bot clones channels which begin with the '⌛' character.
Do not use this bot if you have any channels beginning with the '♻' character and care about those channels, the bot uses this character to denote temporary channels.

# (Quick) How to

With python (supported versions 3.8 through 3.11)
```
AUTOROOMTOKEN='your discord bot token here' python autorooms.py
```

You can also forgo the use of environment variables and instead use the system keyring as detected by the [keyring](https://pypi.org/project/keyring/) library

```
python autorooms.py --setup
```

Will go through setup of this.
